Text-MultiPhone version 0.01
============================

This is yet another solution to the problem of phonetic
similarities. In contrast to L<Soundex> or L<Metaphone>, vowels
matter, and it is thus more useful for other (germanic?) languages. It
has currently implementations for norwegian and german.

In languages, there are often cases where an automated phonetic
analyzer cannot detect the correct pronounciation. I.e. can the german
v be pronounced as english v (as in I<Verb>) or as english f (as in
I<verstehen>), without obvious reason. In those cases, this analyzer
returns both solutions.

While L<Soundex>/L<Metaphone> have been designed for search of similar
(english) names, they give to many and misleading results on a
full-text index.

This module has been proven to be useful for full-text indices, in particular
to detect orthographic errors. It is a pure-perl implementation.
